  # (Optional) When there are multiple fields in the response, using this env variable will filter the fields to expose in the response.
  # For example, if there are 2 flow outputs: "answer", "context", and I only want to have "answer" in the endpoint response, I can set this env variable to '["answer"]'.
  # If you don't set this environment, by default all flow outputs will be included in the endpoint response.
  # PROMPTFLOW_RESPONSE_INCLUDED_FIELDS: '["category", "evidence"]'
